# Project Pizza - Technigo week 1

This project is a part of Techingo(https://www.technigo.io/) JavaScript and React Upskill course fall 2023. This small project was the week 1 assignment. The main goal with this project was mastering vital yet basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals, and native methods.

The project focus was only JavaScript basic and no focus on HTML or CSS.

The assignment was made individual.

## The problem
I followed the project guidelines and developed the program using conditionals. First I used if-statements and later I added a script file with switch statement.
